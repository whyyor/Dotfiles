# tuimessenger

tuimessenger puts the user's WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack and Instagram chats in one terminal app. Its `tuimessenger agent`
commands give you the same chats as JSON. These are the user's private conversations: read only what the task needs,
and never send, forward or paste their contents anywhere else unless the user asks.

The installed binary is the authority for syntax. Start with:

```bash
tuimessenger agent help
tuimessenger agent status
```

`status` tells you whether the agent is logged in (needed only to send), whether the backend is running (needed only
to send), and `synced_at`: data is as fresh as the user's last tuimessenger session. Mention it when freshness
matters ("as of 10:42").

## Reading

```bash
tuimessenger agent chats -unread              # chats with unread messages, newest first
tuimessenger agent chats -limit 20            # the 20 most recent chats
tuimessenger agent messages "Maya" -limit 50  # a chat's newest messages, oldest first
tuimessenger agent search "dinner friday"     # every word as a prefix, newest first
tuimessenger agent search -chat "whatsapp:Maya" invoice
```

- `CHAT` is a chat `id` (`!…`), a name or alias, or `network:name` (`whatsapp`, `telegram`, `slack`, `instagram`).
  Exact names win over partial ones.
- If a name matches several chats you get `{"error": …, "matches": [...]}`. Pick by `network`/`direct` when the user's
  words make it clear, otherwise ask, then use the chat's `id`.
- Messages have `sender` ("you" for the user), `from_me`, `time`, `kind` (text, image, video, audio, file, sticker…),
  `text` (for media: the caption or file name), `reply_to` and `reactions`. You can't see media itself.
- Reading never marks anything as read or tells anyone the user looked.

## Sending

Sending writes to a real person on the user's behalf. Always:

1. Resolve the chat and draft the text **without** `-yes`. Nothing is sent; you get back the chat it resolved to:

   ```bash
   tuimessenger agent send "Maya" "running 10 min late, sorry!"
   ```

2. Show the user the exact recipient (`name` and `network`) and the exact text, and wait for an explicit yes. A
   general instruction earlier ("reply to Maya") is not approval of this draft.
3. Only then send the same command with `-yes`, using the chat `id` from step 1 so it can't resolve differently:

   ```bash
   tuimessenger agent send '!roomid:tuimessenger.localhost' "running 10 min late, sorry!" -yes
   ```

4. Report `result.status`: `delivered`, `sent` (the network hasn't confirmed yet) or `failed` (with `result.error`).
   Don't retry a failed send without asking.

Text after `--` is taken literally, for messages starting with `-`. Only plain text messages can be sent.

## Errors

- **"the agent isn't logged in"**: the user runs `tuimessenger agent login` themselves (it asks for their backend
  password). Never ask for the password or try to log in for them.
- **"the backend isn't running"**: reading still works; to send, the user opens tuimessenger (or starts its service).
- **"no tuimessenger client data here"**: tuimessenger hasn't been set up on this machine (`tuimessenger tui`).

Don't run `tuimessenger agent logout` unless the user asks: it revokes the agent's access.
